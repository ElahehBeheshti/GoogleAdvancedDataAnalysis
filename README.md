✔️1.Foundations of Data Science
What is data science vs. data analytics 
The following table presents a side-by-side comparison:
Data science	Data analytics
• Produces broad insights that concentrate on which questions should be asked about data	• Emphasizes discovering answers to questions being asked 
• Confronts what is unknown by using advanced techniques to make predictions about the future 	• Determines actionable insights that can be applied immediately based on existing queries

The connections between data science and data analytics: both discover insights that can be used to lead an organization to improve and grow. 

📊📈the Common Types of Data Visualizations
	• Bar Chart: Compare quantities across categories.
	• Line Chart: Show trends over time or continuous data.
	• Histogram: Show the distribution of numerical data across ranges.
	• Pie Chart: Represent proportions or percentages.
	• Scatter Plot: Show relationships or correlations between two variables.
	• Heat Map: Highlight values using colors (e.g., intensity, frequency).
	• Tree Map: Show proportions hierarchically.
	• Box Plot: Show data distribution and identify outliers.
  •Bubble Chart: Show three variables using x-axis, y-axis, and bubble size.
